Adds inaccuracy to direct-fire weapons based on darkness and illumination.

Supports Searchlight Assault and LargerLamps.

# Roadmap
  - Possible use `create_local_flying_text` to generate settings-togglable 'miss' text when attacks miss to make mod function clear to users.
  - Use lamp prototype (ex: `lamp.small-lamp.light.size` & `intensity`) to scale size & brightness of light affect on darkness. Grab settings from other maps for this as well. (i.e: larger lamps, spotlight assault, vanilla flashlights, vehicle headlights, etc)
